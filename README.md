# Brain Tumor Detection

This repository contains implementations of the AlexNet and ResNet models for brain tumor detection using deep learning.

## Introduction

Detecting brain tumors from medical images is a crucial task in healthcare. Deep learning models have shown promising results in automating this process. This repository provides implementations of two popular neural network architectures, AlexNet and ResNet, for the classification of brain tumor images.

## Models

### AlexNet

AlexNet is a deep convolutional neural network that gained attention for its success in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012. It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers.

### ResNet

ResNet (Residual Network) introduced residual connections to enable the training of very deep neural networks. It uses skip connections to add the output of earlier layers to later layers, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.

## Dataset

The models in this repository were trained and evaluated using the kaggle dataset consisting of brain MRI images with corresponding tumor labels. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset cannot be provided directly within this repository.
