# Brain Tumor Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to detect brain tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We have implemented three different CNN architectures: AlexNet, and ResNet. The project includes a comparative analysis between these models to evaluate their performance in brain tumor detection.


## Models Implemented

- CNN
- ResNet
- AlexNet
